Telephus
========

Son of Heracles who loved Cassandra. He went a little crazy, at one point. One
might almost say he was twisted.

Description
-----------

Telephus is a connection pooled, low-level client API for Cassandra in Twisted
(Python).


Installation
------------

Prerequisites:

* Python >= 2.4 (2.5 or later for tests)
* Twisted 8.1.0 or later
* Thrift (latest svn)


Usage
-----

See example.py for an example of how to use the Telephus API.


Unit Tests
----------

To run the unit tests, simply use the Twisted test runner, ``trial``::

 $ trial telephus

The tests are included in the source code, so this should work even if you are
not running it from the source checkout directory.
